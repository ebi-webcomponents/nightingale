Nightingale is a library of re-usable data visualisation Web Components, which can
be used to display protein sequence features, variants, interaction data,
3D structure, etc. These components are flexible, allowing you to easily view multiple
data sources (UniProt API, your own resource, etc) within the same context.

## What's new in version 4.0?

We are working on migrating all the components, using [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as our codebase.

All the components are now using the prefix `nightingale-` on their names, so if you
are using the `protvista-*` means you are still on version `<=3`.

Attribute names now follow the [kebab-case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case)
convention, so there is a chance that if you are upgrading from previous versions,
you need to change some of the attributes.
Please check the Readme file for each component for details in valid attributes.

## Still looking for version 3.X?

The landing page for version 3 is [HERE](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/v3/)
and all components are still in npm, and won't be removed, but unfortunately we don't have the
capacity to keep their maintanance as we will be focus on the new version.
