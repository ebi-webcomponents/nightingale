# Getting Started

In this tutorial we will show you how to:

- [Use Nightingale within HTML](#use-nightingale-within-html)
- [Install from NPM](#install-from-npm)
- [Use Nightingale with React](#use-nightingale-with-react)

**Note** in this tutorial we will use the `nightingale-sequence` component for the examples but
the same steps apply for all of the Nightingale components.

## Use Nightingale within HTML

We will demonstrate how to use a `nightingale-sequence` within HTML. All nightingale components
are compiled down to ES2020 before being distributed via [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com).
So firstly we must create an [import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
to resolve es-module imports. After this we can import `nightingale-sequence` within a `<script type="module">` element.
After these steps we can use the component just as you would a regular HTML tag. Complete example below:

<Sandpack
  template="static"
  files={{
    "index.html": `<!-- Firstly create an importmap to resolve module imports -->
  <script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@nightingale-elements/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nightingale-elements/"
    }
  }
</script>
<!-- Import the component -->
<script type="module">
  import "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence@latest";
</script>
<!-- Use the component just as you would a regular HTML tag -->
<nightingale-sequence
  sequence="SEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCE"
  width="800"
  height="40"
  length="32"
  display-start="10"
  display-end="20"
  highlight="3:15"
  id="my-nightingale-sequence-id"
></nightingale-sequence>
`,
  }}
/>

### Polyfills

If you are not using a modern browser you may have to use a [polyfill](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims)
for the import maps.

### Setting the sequence property

As well as setting the sequence as an attribute of the `nightingale-sequence`,
it's also possible to load this as a property as seen in the following code snippet:

<Sandpack
  template="static"
  files={{
    "index.html": `<!-- Firstly create an importmap to resolve module imports -->
  <script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@nightingale-elements/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nightingale-elements/"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module">
  // Import the component
  import "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence@latest";
  
  // Once the element is defined, set the sequence data
  customElements.whenDefined("nightingale-sequence").then(() => {
    const seq = document.querySelector("#my-nightingale-sequence-id");
    seq.data = "SEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCE";
  })
</script>
<!-- Use the component just as you would a regular HTML tag -->
<nightingale-sequence
  width="800"
  height="40"
  length="32"
  display-start="10"
  display-end="20"
  highlight="3:15"
  id="my-nightingale-sequence-id"
></nightingale-sequence>`,
  }}
/>

## Install from NPM

All components are exported as modules and available from NPM. For example to install the `nightingale-sequence`
in your project with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install @nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence
```

Then to import in your application as a module:

```js
import NightingaleSequence from "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence";
```

Note that all of the other Nightingale components can be installed and used in exactly the same way.

## Use Nightingale with React

We will demonstrate how to use a `nightingale-sequence` within a React component and how to load the sequence
using a reference.

Note that this code snippet depends on `nightingale-sequence` being [installed from NPM](#install-from-npm).

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence": "latest",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": `import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-sequence";
 
export default function App() {
 
  const seqContainer = useRef(null);
  
  const seq = "SEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCESEQUENCE";
  
  useEffect(()=> {
    if(seqContainer && customElements.whenDefined("nightingale-sequence")) {
      seqContainer.current.data = seq;
    }
  }, [seq]);
   
  return <nightingale-sequence
    ref={seqContainer}
    width="800"
    height="40"
    length="32"
    display-start="10"
    display-end="20"
    highlight="3:15"
  ></nightingale-sequence>;
}`,
  }}
/>

### Usage with other popular libraries and frameworks

Since this project relies on a web standard, namely
[custom-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements),
its use should be made easier and cross-library bugs and unwanted interactions should be reduced significantly.

Depending on the library or framework you are using, you might want to consider
[having a look here](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) to check possible
pitfalls and consider workarounds.
