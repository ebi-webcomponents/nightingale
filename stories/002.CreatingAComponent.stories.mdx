# HOW TO CREATE A BASIC COMPONENT (Hello World)

This document describes the creation of a basic Nightingale component.

## Steps to get a `Hello World` component.

1. Create the folder for your component under the `packages/` folder. This will ensure that the scripts defined in the main `package.json` can operate in the new component.
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello
   ```
2. Create a folder for your source code `src/` and one for your tests `test/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/src
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/tests
   ```
3. Create the `package.json` for the new component. Here is an example of its content:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "nightingale-hello",
     "version": "4.0.0",
     "description": "Basic usage",
     "files": ["dist", "src"],
     "main": "dist/index.js",
     "module": "dist/index.js",
     "type": "module",
     "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
     "scripts": {
       "build": "rollup --config ../../rollup.config.mjs"
     },
     "publishConfig": {
       "access": "public"
     },
     "keywords": ["nightingale", "webcomponents", "customelements"],
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale.git"
     },
     "bugs": {
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale/issues"
     },
     "homepage": "https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/",
     "dependencies": {
       "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core": "^4.0.0",
       "d3": "7.9.0"
     }
   }
   ```

4. All nightingale components are written in TypeScript. We need a file `tsconfig.json` with the following content for TypeScript compilation.

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./dist"
     },
     "include": ["./src"]
   }
   ```

5. Create the entrypoint for webpack. The current setup of the nightingale project looks for `src/index.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import NightingaleHello from "./nightingale-hello";

    export default NightingaleHello;
    ```

6. Create the file where the code of your custom element will be. In our example `src/nightingale-hello.ts`.

   1. To start we can create a Hello world document with this code:

      ```typescript
      import { html } from "lit";
      import NightingaleElement from "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core";
      import { customElement, property } from "lit/decorators.js";

      @customElement("nightingale-hello")
      class NightingaleHello extends NightingaleElement {
        @property({ type: String, attribute: "name" })
        name = "";

        render() {
          return html`<p>Hello ${this.name}!</p>`;
        }
      }

      export default NightingaleHello;
      ```

      Here are some notes of this code:

      - The library used to build the web components in Nightingale is [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/).
      - The `@customElement` decorator is used for defining the custom element following the web component standard of defining and registering custom elements.
      - The component rendering is defined by the method `render()`.

   2. The above example inherits from `NightingaleElement` which extends the [LitElement](https://lit.dev/docs/api/LitElement/) itself.
      It is recommended for any Nightinagle component to extend the same.

   3. Any logic that should be shared among all the components are included in it as a `mixin`.

      For instance, `NightingaleHello` needs to use margin mixin, it is inherited as follows:

      ```typescript
      class NightingaleHello extends withMargin(NightingaleElement) {
       ...
      }
      ```

      If it needs to add more, say highlight behaviour, it is included as:

      ```typescript
      class NightingaleHello extends withMargin(withHighlight(NightingaleElement)) {
       ...
      }
      ```

   4. In order to define attributes for the element, use Lit's `@property` decorator. The `@property` decorator declares a reactive property and there is no need to capture using `attributeChangedCallback`.

      ```typescript
      @property({ type: String })
      ```

   5. Event Handling

      If the new component needs to fire events that other Nightingale components could use via `<nightingale-manager>`, it has to be of type change and the detail object should contain the attributes `type` and `value`.

      ```html
      <nightingale-manager reflected-attributes="attr1 attr2">
        <nightingale-hello attr1="X" attr2="Y" />
      </nightingale-manager>
      ```

      Here is an example of how the child component should fire the event:

      ```typescript
      this.dispatchEvent(
        new CustomEvent("change", {
          detail: {
            value: "New value",
            type: "attr1",
          },
        })
      );
      ```

   6. Here is a snippet of `nightingale-hello.ts` using mixins and firing events.

      ```typescript
      import { html } from "lit";
      import { customElement, property } from "lit/decorators.js";

      import NightingaleElement, {
        withMargin,
        withHighlight,
      } from "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core";

      @customElement("nightingale-hello")
      class NightingaleHello extends withMargin(
        withHighlight(NightingaleElement)
      ) {
        @property({ type: String, attribute: "name" })
        name = "";

        render() {
          return html`
            <p>Hello ${this.name}!</p>
            <button
              @click=${() => {
                this.dispatchEvent(
                  new CustomEvent("change", {
                    detail: {
                      name: this.name,
                    },
                    bubbles: true,
                  })
                );
              }}
            >
              I am here
            </button>
          `;
        }
      }

      export default NightingaleHello;
      ```

7. Let `yarn` and `lerna` know about your new component by making them.

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

8. To view it in the showcase application, create a story `NightingaleHello.stories.ts` in `stories/` folder.

    ```typescript
    import { Meta, Story } from "@storybook/web-components";
    import { html } from "lit-html";
    import "../../packages/nightingale-hello/src/index.ts";
    
    export default {
      title: "Components/Hello",
    } as Meta;
    
    const Template: Story<{
      "name": string;
    }> = (args) => {
      return html`<nightingale-hello name=${args["name"] />`;
    };
    
    export const Hello = Template.bind({});
    Hello.args = {
      "name": "World",
    };
    ```

9. The following command runs the storybook locally to test.

    ```bash
    yarn storybook
    ```
